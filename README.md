# Voyagers_Cosmic_Catalogue

Overview

Welcome Aboard, Voyager! 

Ready to embark on an exciting journey through the cosmos? 

Voyager's Cosmic Catalogue is your trusted resource as you explore the mysteries of the universe alongside Science Voyager. This repository is an essential companion to our YouTube channel, where we get immersed in the wonders of the universe—from Stardust to Singularity. Here, you'll discover celestial objects, and their coordinates, all neatly curated for your exploration. 


What’s Inside the Catalogue?

Catalogue List: A comprehensive list of constellations, stars, and cosmic objects we explore in our videos, complete with key data like right ascension and declination (their celestial coordinates).

Resources: Access additional files (uploaded when necessary) and documentation to help you navigate the catalogue and engage with the cosmic easter eggs or future challenges we feature. 


How to Use Voyager’s Cosmic Catalogue?

Locate Easter Egg Clues: As you watch our Science Voyager videos, keep an eye out for hidden Easter egg clues, including coordinates encoded in Morse code (or other encodings) or subtle hints pointing to specific stars, black holes, and more. These will lead you to the mystery entries in the catalogue.

Decode the Coordinates: Each clue in our videos comes with coordinates in the celestial format. Use these to find corresponding objects in the catalogue.

Leverage the Constellation Clue: To make the Easter egg hunt enjoyable yet approachable, we include the name of the relevant constellation in the video description. This acts as a helpful nudge, narrowing your search within the catalogue of 9,000+ alphabetically numbered entries. While this makes the challenge easier (Easter egg Level: Easy), it still encourages active participation and exploration.

Prepare for Future Challenges: As the series progresses, we’ll introduce more difficult Easter egg hunts, requiring deeper decoding, exploration, and problem-solving to find the answers.

For an extra layer of intrigue, some coordinates might align with visually striking celestial objects or well-known features of the night sky. This invites you to explore these cosmic landmarks further, and go on a lookout for them. 


Celestial Coordinate Format

All catalogue entries follow the standard celestial coordinate system: 

Right Ascension (RA): Hours, minutes, seconds (e.g., 19h 58m 21s)

Declination (Dec): Degrees, minutes, seconds (e.g., +35° 12' 32")

This format helps pinpoint the locations of stars, black holes, and other celestial objects in the night sky with high precision. 


For instance, the coordinates:

Right Ascension (RA): 19h 58m 21s

Declination (Dec): +35° 12' 32"

point to the star Vega, the brightest in the constellation Lyra. To make the search less daunting, the constellation name (in this case, Lyra) would be mentioned in the video description, helping you narrow down your search and enjoy the experience without feeling overwhelmed.
