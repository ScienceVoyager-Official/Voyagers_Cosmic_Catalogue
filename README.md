# Voyagers_Cosmic_Catalogue

Overview

Welcome to Voyager's Cosmic Catalogue! ðŸŒŒ This repository is an essential companion to the Science Voyager YouTube channel, where we explore the mysteries of the universe, black holes, and beyond. Here, youâ€™ll find our interactive Cosmic Catalogueâ€”a curated list of celestial objects, coordinates, and cosmic phenomena that expands with each new video.

In our videos, hidden clues and coordinates guide you on a cosmic scavenger hunt. Use this catalogue as your map through the universe, designed to enhance your exploration and learning experience as you decode Easter eggs in our content!

Repository Contents

Catalogue List: A detailed constellation and celestial object list, complete with names, right ascension, declination, and other essential data for cosmic objects we feature.

Resources: Additional files and documentation to assist with using the catalogue and participating in our cosmic challenges.

Updates: As new videos are released, this catalogue will grow to include more constellations and cosmic objects.

How to Use Voyager's Cosmic Catalogue

Locate Easter Egg Clues: While watching Science Voyager videos, watch for Easter egg coordinates in Morse code or hidden hints that point to specific stars, black holes, or other objects.

Decode the Coordinates: Use the coordinate format provided in each videoâ€™s description to match clues to an entry in this catalogue.

Explore Celestial Connections: Each entry here can deepen your understanding of our video content, adding context and fun facts about the constellations and objects we explore.

For an extra hint, some objects in the catalogue might relate to notable historical or mythological figuresâ€”a nod to their significance in both ancient and modern astronomy.

Coordinate Format

All coordinates in this catalogue follow the standard celestial format:

Right Ascension (RA): Hours, minutes, seconds (e.g., 19h 58m 21s)

Declination (Dec): Degrees, minutes, seconds (e.g., +35Â° 12' 32")

If youâ€™re new to celestial coordinates, this format pinpoints the exact location of stars or other celestial objects in the night sky.
